  abstract = {Cochlear implants (CI) are electronic devices incorporating an electrode
	inserted into the human cochlea for direct electric stimulation of
	the auditory nerve. The implantation has become the standard treatment
	for patients with severe-to-profound sensorineural loss not aidable
	with conventional hearing aids. The state of the art operative technique
	is a facial recess approach to the middle ear, following the opening
	of the scala tympani (cochleostomy) and insertion of the electrode
	array. The facial recess approach is applicable only by experienced
	surgeons and optimal CI results primarily depend on optimal electrode
	placement and minimal traumatic insertion. This also requires a certain
	amount of experience. Additionally several groups work on minimally-invasive
	approaches to the cochlea, resulting in the necessity to insert the
	implant via a keyhole access, which is not applicable with current
	techniques. This paper presents a mechatronic device for an automated
	insertion of the electrode array of a cochlear implant system. Being
	designed especially for minimally-invasive approaches, the tool is
	also applicable for regular facial recess approaches. Moreover the
	device allows reliable and repeatable insertion studies at synthetic
	models or cadaver specimen. The functionality of the tool is proofed
	with first experiments on a synthetic model.},

  abstract = {Atraumatic electrode insertion has been identified to be a crucial
	step for the preservation of residual hearing abilities, which allows
	hybrid electro-acoustic stimulation (EAS). The authors propose a
	tool for automation of the insertion process to achieve this.General
	benefits as well as concept and design of an automated insertion
	tool are presented. Thirty insertions of Nucleus 24 Contour Advance
	Practice Electrodes in an artificial scala tympani model as well
	as 20 insertions in a human cochlea specimen were performed using
	the tool, implementing the AOS technique. For both studies, the achieved
	insertion depth angle was evaluated by photographic or X-ray documentation.The
	mean achieved insertion depth angle was 410 degrees for the lubricated
	model and 330 degrees for the human cochlea specimen.The automated
	insertion tool has proven its capability to perform electrode insertions
	with final insertion depth angles within the target range of a standard
	cochlear implant surgery. Additionally, to the knowledge of the authors,
	it represents the only possibility to automatically insert cochlear
	implant electrodes via minimally invasive approaches.},

	Multi-Strategy Cochlear Implant (1.2 device) was evaluated preimplantation
	and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postimplantation. The children
	were between 15 months and 15 years of age. The test materials consisted
	of 8 tests involving syllable structure, single- and 2-syllable words,
	differentiation of word pairs, and sentences. Two difficulty levels
	were used, depending on developmental age (<7, and 7 to 15 years).
	There was an improvement in test scores over time for both age groups.
	The younger children (particularly those under age 4) improved steadily
	over the first 2 years, while the older children tended to plateau
	between 12 and 18 months after implantation. These findings demonstrate
	that deaf children up to 15 years old benefit from cochlear implants.
	Children under 4 years of age may even have the ability to compensate
	for delays in speech development before they reach school age.},

	can be used to duplicate a complex surgical motion in inserting cochlear
	implant (CI) electrode arrays via the 'advance-off-stylet' (AOS)
	technique. As compared with human operators, the forces generated
	by the robot were slightly larger but the robot was more reliable
	(i.e. less force maxima).We present force data collected during CI
	electrode insertion by human operators and by an automated insertion
	tool.Using a three-dimensional, anatomically correct, translucent
	model of the scala tympani chamber of the cochlea, CI electrodes
	were inserted either by one of three surgeons (26 insertions) or
	by the robotic insertion tool (8 insertions). Force was recorded
	using a load beam cell calibrated for expected forces of <0.1 Newtons
	(N). The insertions were also videotaped to allow correlation of
	force with depth of penetration into the cochlea and speed of insertion.Average
	insertion force used by the surgeons was 0.004+/-0.001 N and for
	the insertion tool it was 0.005+/-0.014 N (p<0.00001, Student's t
	test). While the average insertion force of the automated tool was
	larger than that of the surgeons, the surgeons did have intermittent
	peaks during the AOS component of the insertion (between 120 degrees
	and 200 degrees ).},
